# Cannagotchi (WIP)
Welcome to Cannagotchi! A web app aimed to help you track your weed crops and maintain a control over your plants. You can start using it just by making a new account using an email address, is that simple!

## What can you find?

Cannagotchi provides different tools to help you stablish a detailed control of your crops by adding your plants to a collection. Then you can see a detailed list of information for a specific plant (germination date and genetic family among others). In addition you can see an estimate harvest date that will help you remembering plants cycles.

### How cannagotchi was build?

The app was built using the MERN stack in combination with Firebase for authentication. Using mongo DB for database handling, Node JS and Express JS for the development of the server, and React JS for the client side.

In addition all the styling of the app was made using only plain CSS, and the sprites were made by me using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

### How to run it?

To run Cannagotchi locally you can just clone the entire repo and then git bash from server folder running "nodemon index.js". For the client side running "npm start" from git bash on client folder should be enough. To run the app from the web browser you'll have to wait until deployment is ready, since this is a Work In Progress.
